      "news": "It appears that sometime last week, Google tweaked the Play Store’s algorithm that determines app discovery. When we reached out to Google about the matter, we were told that Google is regularly evaluating new ways to improve the Play Store’s ranking algorithms to promote high-quality applications. We would like to stress that there is no evidence that Google is altering the algorithm to intentionally harm indie developers in favor of big-name apps (despite rampant speculation otherwise) The changes are aimed at improving the experience for both users and developers alike. We do not have any details on exactly how the algorithm was changed (which makes sense, as disclosing that information would give an unfair advantage to certain developers) but it’s clear that the changes are making a significant impact on some independent developers."
